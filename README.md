# ABIN733 Jupyter Notebook - CRISP-DM for Iteration 4 BDAS

AWS EC2 Instance Description - i-0398ac652dd3d3e27 (INFOSYS722)
The AWS EC2 instance with the ID "i-0398ac652dd3d3e27," also known as "INFOSYS722," is a robust and versatile virtual machine created from the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) "722-v3." It is configured with the instance type "t2.medium," making it suitable for a wide range of computing tasks while remaining cost-effective.
•	AMI Used: "722-v3" - This is the base Amazon Machine Image from which the instance was launched. It include a specific set of software packages, configurations, or optimizations tailored for this assignment.
•	Instance Type: "t2.medium" - This instance type strikes a balance between CPU performance and memory capacity. It is equipped with 2 vCPUs and 4 GiB of memory, 32 GB of storage making it suitable for data mining.

GitHub Repository: The EC2 instance is connected to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/abin733/aws-instance-abin733/. This GitHub repository is to contain the code, data, and resources necessary for data mining and data analysis using Jupyter Notebook.
